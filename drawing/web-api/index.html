            Fun Translations API is an API that, when given text, translates it into a certain type of speech. In this case, text is translated to Shakespearean, but there are also other options like Elvish and Pirate-speak. Moreover, based on the amount of words that are returned from the API, the angle of the gradient will change. One thing I had to keep in mind was the encoding of text so that it would be valid when sent to the API. This meant that I had to use the encodeURIComponent() function on the text (after validating that the <textarea> was not left blank). The API is not perfect, however; it has a hard time dealing with commas and other punctuation; I assume this is because this API was designed with shorter text input in mind.
