          <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap</a> is an API
          that provides accurate weather data, similar to the example presented
          in class. In this case, however, I am utilizing the One Call API
          endpoint to access cloudiness of the current location, which affects
          the blurriness of the text below. The more cloudy it is, the blurrier
          the text is. Sometimes there is no visible change since cloudiness %
          varies quite a bit. Thus, a second layer of visual change was added,
          where the linear gradient background changes depending on the
          temperature where the website was accessed from. Other APIs were
          considered, but often required OAuth which was a bit out of the scope
          of this project.
